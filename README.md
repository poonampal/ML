**Machine Learning(ML)** - ML is a subset of Artificial Intelligence(AI) that enables system to learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

**Types of Machine Learning:**

	1. Supervised Learning: Alogorithem learns based on labels and makes prediction based on learning.
	2. Unsupervised Learning: Algorithem learns based on unlabeled data.
	3. Reinforcement Learning: Algorithem learns by interacting with enviornment and receiving feedback in the form of rewards/penalties.
	4. Semi-Supervised Learning
	
**Prerequisites of ML:**

	1. Mathematics and Statistics
		1.Linear Algebra: vectors, matrix, eagenvalue, eagenvector
		2. Calculus: derivatives and gradients
		3. Probability and Statistics: probability distribution, hypothesis testing
	2. PRogramming Skills
		Python, R, SQL
	3. Basic Concepts of ML
		Data Collection and Cleaning
  		1. Collection data from various sources
  		2. Cleaning data to ensure quality and consistency
		Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
  		1. Data Analysis with summary
  		2. visual method for data exploration
		Feature Engineering
  		1. Creating New Features or Modifying existing one (developing new variables, transforming data)
  		2. improving model performance (feature selection, normalization, standardization and encoding categorical variables)

**Supervised Learning:**

	1. Regression - includes linear regression for predicting continuous variables and polynomial regression for modeling non-linear relationships
	2. Classification - includes logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines.
	
**Unsupervised Learning:**

	1. Clustering - algorithems like k-means, hierarchical clustering  and DBSCAN 
	2. Dimensionality Reduction - PCA, t-SNE
	3. Anomaly Detection - identifies outliers or unusual patterns in data
		
**Reinforcement Learning:**

	1. Basic Concepts: agents, environments, rewards and policies
	2. Algorithms: Q-LEarning, SARSA and deep reinforcement learning techniques like deep-Q-networks (DQN)
	3. Applications: game, robotics and autonomous systems
	
**Semi-Supervised Learning:**
	1. combine labeled and unlabeled data to improve learning


**ML Process**

**Model Selection:**

	Problem Type: based on problem/nature of task such as regression, classification, clustering 
	Feature Characteristics: Evaluate the type of features (categorical, numerical) and their relationships to guide model selection
	Business Objectives: ensure the chosen model aligns with business goals and constraints, such as accuracy needs, interpretability or resource limitations
	
**Model Evaluation and Tuning:**

	Imbalance Data: 
		Resampling Techniques: oversampling/undersampling minority/majority class to balance dataset
		Synthetic Data: SMOTE(Synthetic minority over sampling Technique) to generate synthetic data
		
	Hyperparameter Tuning (Optimizing model performance):
		Identifying Key Hyperparameters: determine which hyperparameters such as learning rate, or number of layers have the most impact on model performance
		Refining Hyperparameters: Continuously adjust hyperparameters values to improve model accuracy and efficiency
		Optimization methods: 
			Grid Search: Performs an exhaustive search over a predefined set of hyperparameter values
			Random Search: Samples of hyperparameter values chosed randomly from specified distribution
			
	Model Evaluation:
		Cross-Validation: use techniques like k-fold cross validation to evaluate models generalizability and robustness across different data subsets
		Train-Test Split: Split data into training and testing sets to validate model performance on unseen data
		
	Evaluation Metrics: 
		Performance of Classification models:
			1. Precision
			2. Recall
			3. Accuracy
			4. F1-score
			5. ROC-AUC
			
	  Performance of regression model:
			1. RMSE
			2. MSE
			3. MAE
			4. R-Squared
			5. MAPE
